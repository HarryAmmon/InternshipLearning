                <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Harry and I'm a software developer. I'm an Intern for The Pensions Regulator and have spent the last year absorbing as much knowledge as possible!</p>
                <p>Based in South-East England, I can be found cooking, cycling or in a beer garden!</p>
                <p>I have learnt a lot over the last year. I built this site to demonstrate what I know and what I have learnt.</p>
